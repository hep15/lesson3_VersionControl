            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in a specific computer file that can be shared among multiple people. It is primarily used for software development, but can be used to keep track of changes in almost any files. Git prevents people from unintentionally overwriting the file on the shared repository. Companies choose to use it because it makes team projects easier. More people can work on the same assignment without screwing one or more people up.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that records all the changes to a file or group of files over time so you can go back to specific files. If you are a web developer or a graphic designer, you most likely want to keep every version of a layout or image. Version control allows you to do that. Version control will not overwrite any files. It allows you to revert files back to previous state, compare changes over time, check to see who has modified what and when they modified it, figure out who introduced an issue, etc.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are a lot of things you can do to create and edit your Git repository. In order to create a repository, in windows at least, has a few steps. You first need to make sure you are in your repository, $ cd/c/user/your_repository. Once in the file, type $git init. Your next step would be to type “$ git add .”, followed by “$ git commit -m ‘lesson 4 first commit’”. You should then open Github and create a repository on the site and then go back to your terminal. In order to push the files to your remote repository, you need to type or paste “$ git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/PROJECT-TITLE.git” and  “$ git push -u origin master”. After you’re done editing your file, you should push the files again.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The local repository refers to a copy on your own installation that is a cache of the remote downloads. Local repositories also contain the temporary build artifacts that you have not yet released. Remote repositories refer to any other type of repository, accessed by a variety of protocols such as file:// and http://. When you are working on an assignment locally, other people do not have access to your files but as soon as you switch to a remote repository everyone who has access to the repository can work on it. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Of course, choosing to use a version control system like Git, you will need to know some basic commands in order to get the job done. “git init” is a command used to initialize a brand new git repository. “git add --all” does exactly what it sounds like it does. “git add --all” adds the file to the repository. “git commit -m ‘Initial commit’” commits your file to the remote repository. “git status” will tell you what the status of your repository is.</p>
